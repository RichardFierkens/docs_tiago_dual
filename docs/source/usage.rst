Using TiagoDual
===============

Start Up
--------
Tiago has been ported to ROS2, this has lead to some changes, but not for starting the tiago. Make sure that the Tiago is in a free space when turning on. Due to the fact that the torso might go up and the arms will move. 

	1. Unrelease the emergency button (1)
	2. Press the power switch. It will turn red when it is on.(2)
	3. Hold the on/off button (green) for 1 second.
